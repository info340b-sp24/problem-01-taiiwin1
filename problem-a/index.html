        <li>Naruto was the reason I started liking anime; his character's personality hooked me in as a kid</li>  
        <li class="item">I thought his backstory was very sad, but loved how he pushed through his life regardless</li> 
        <li>In the show itself, I like his cool abilities!</li>
